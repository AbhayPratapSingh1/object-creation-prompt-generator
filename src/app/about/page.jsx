            <div className="font-semibold text-2xl text-blue-950">Hello Everyone!</div>
            <p className="">This is the about page of this website. So, for now make it simple page!</p>
            <p className=''>I am Abhay Pratap Singh, and from the last weeks my team and me are working on character sketch template. so thought why shouldn't i create a website for this so that we can generate prompt using Template.</p>
            <p className=''>Using this prompt we can generate some character images, by generating these images we can use them in the different PPTs and animations. these thing allow us to create custom Character of our own choice</p>
            <p className=''>The thought came in the mind of you is that why should we use this? we can directly give prompt to the gpt and use it, Right! but fact is that at that time when we write a prompt we forget to mension some details and something we just skip them, making out character a little but weired! so, we can use it to create without forgetting any detail which we required</p>
            <p className=''>Don't want to speek to much now!</p>
            <p className=''>So, it i explain future of this then, i would like to make it dynamic in nature! means we can add more and several items in it like (chair, table, almera, etc) if one intern work on 1 item in 2 weeks then we can collect arround 50+ template easily! even if 50% doesn't do then still we are able to do 20+ template which we normally see or use.</p>
            <p className=''>Maybe someone find it usefull someday, I don't expect that much but still I think this will help others and me!</p>
            <p className=''>Thank you for reading this, please let me know if you read this! just say anything! i drop my phone no in the bottom</p>
